These methods are:\n\n1. \"circle\": This is the default method and creates a plot with circles representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables.\n\n2. \"square\": This method creates a plot with squares representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables.\n\n3. \"ellipse\": This method creates a plot with ellipses representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables. The eccentricity of the ellipses is scaled to the correlation value.\n\n4. \"number\": This method creates a plot with numbers representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables.\n\n5. \"pie\": This method creates a plot with pie charts representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables.\n\n6. \"shade\": This method creates a plot with shaded rectangles representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables.\n\n7. \"color\": This method creates a plot with colored rectangles representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables.\n\nYou can specify the method you want to use by setting the `method` parameter of the `corrplot()` function to one of these values. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you can choose the one that best suits your needs.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://rdrr.io/cran/corrplot/man/corrplot.html\n[2] https://rdrr.io/cran/corrplot/f/vignettes/corrplot-intro.Rmd\n[3] https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html\n[4] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24298793/how-do-i-interpret-the-output-of-corrplot\n[5] https://statisticsglobe.com/correlation-matrix-in-r\n[6] https://www.statology.org/correlation-matrix-in-r/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Plots","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(df, aes(x = Pre_Intervention_Depression, y = Pre_Intervention_Anxiety)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 3)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-22T00:34:52.178535Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-22T00:34:52.180981Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-22T00:34:52.462088Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Making a subset with the intervention group\nintervention_subset <- subset(df, Group == \"Intervention\")\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-22T00:36:07.537050Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-22T00:36:07.540679Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-22T00:36:07.564928Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(intervention_subset, aes(x = Pre_Intervention_Depression, y = Post_Intervention_Depression)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Pre vs Post Intervention Depression\",\n       x = \"Pre-Intervention Depression\", y = \"Post-Intervention Depression\")\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-22T00:38:32.442337Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-22T00:38:32.444356Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-22T00:38:32.749312Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
